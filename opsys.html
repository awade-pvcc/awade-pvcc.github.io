    <tr>
        <td>super user (or administrator)</td>
        <td>A user of the device that gains privileged access to the operating system. This elevated access allows an install or upgrade of software, make changes to the operating system, grant elevated privileges to other users, and perform maintenance other users are not able to perform.</td>
