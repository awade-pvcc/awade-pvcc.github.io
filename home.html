    <h2>Overview of Creation and Responsiblities</h2>

    <h2>Department Origins</h2>

    <p>The Department of Homeland Security is comprised of 22 federal departments and agencies that came together with the goal of being a unified, a more effective entity that would establish a strengthened homeland security enterprise and a more secure America that is better prepared to confront the range of threats we face. This agency was formed in response to significant hardships as a nation and the rising threats both domestic and abroad in an ever-changing world.
      It was 11 days after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks that Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge was appointed as the first Director of the Office of Homeland Security. This office spearheaded the coordinated effort for a national strategic defense to keep the country safe against terrorism and also strategize the response for any future terrorist attacks. When Congress passed the Homeland Security Act in November 2002, it officially marked the beginning of the Department of Homeland Security. Congresses actions created a Cabinet-level department that was tasked with continued coordination to solidify efforts to achieve a secure homeland. The department doors opened on the 1st of March 2003.
      By February 15, 2005, Secretary Michael Chertoff, an attorney from New Jersey, took office and started a 2SR, Second Stage Review. The review evaluated the department’s structures, policies, and operations. With over 250 members of the department and 18 action teams participating in the review, the next stage of restructuring the department began to take shape. By July 13th of the same year, Secretary Chertoff presented a six-point agenda that reorganized the department. (Creation)      
    </p>

    <h2>Structural Adjustments</h2>

    <p>A six point agenda for the department was developed by Secretary Chertoff. Presented in July of 2005, the agenda was created to reaffirm that the policies, operations, and structures were aligned to address potential threats in the best possible way. These structural changes included:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Increase overall preparedness, particularly for catastrophic events.</li>
      <li>Create better transportation security systems to move people and cargo more securely and efficiently.</li>
      <li>Strengthen border security and interior enforcement and reform the immigration process.</li>
      <li>Enhance information sharing with our partners.</li>
      <li>Improve DHS financial management, human resource development, procurement and information technology.</li>
      <li>Realign the DHS organization to maximize mission performance. (Department)</li>  
    </ol>

    <h2>Specific Offices Within DHS</h2>

    <h4>The offices and departments below are just a few of the integral parts to the success of the DHS. They also help to incorporate and improve policy development and coordination.</h4>

    <p>The Office of Policy was created to:</p>

    </ol>

    <p>The Office of Policy is one of the many departments that make up the DHS. It is a mission-oriented department for the Secretary, Deputy, and the Component Heads which is tasked with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Advise the Secretary and Deputy Secretary</li>
      <li>Develop policy, including representing the Department in Interagency fora</li>
      <li>Coordinate and unify policy positions</li>

    <h2>Bolster Information Collaboration and Intelligence Functions</h2>

    <p>The Office of Intelligence and Analysis, also referred to as I&A, is the only IC (Intelligence Community) pillar that is responsible for presenting intelligence to our State, Local, Tribal and Territorial (SLTT) and private sector partners. Through this collaboration, the I&A also develops intelligence from those partnerships for the DHS and the IC. The I&A is led by the Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis, Ken Wainstein, another former attorney. I&A focuses on integration at the tactical level by providing strategic analysis on the threats to the country. This is achieved through aligning intelligence resources across the Intelligence Enterprise (IE) to identify and effectively deal with threats.</p>
    <p>I&A accomplishes the Department’s mission by integrating intelligence into operations across DHS Components, its partners in state and local government and the private sector to identify, mitigate and respond to threats. These efforts are centered on specific operating principles:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Foster a fully synchronized, cohesive enterprise that integrates intelligence into operational functions and drives action through Mission Centers to mitigate all threats to the Homeland, including: Counterintelligence, Counterterrorism, Cyber, Economic Security, and Transnational Organized Crime.</li>
      <li>Drive multi-directional information exchanges with State, Local, Tribal and Territorial (SLTT), private sector and foreign partners to fill critical information and intelligence gaps.</li>
      <li>Produce strategic intelligence products that leverage law enforcement, unique DHS data and Intelligence Community (IC) holdings to facilitate intelligence-driven decision making by all levels of DHS leadership, other U.S. Government policymakers and SLTT partners.</li>
      <li>Deliver access to data and systems, infrastructure and analytic expertise, mission readiness services and Intelligence Community (IC) capabilities to DHS Operational Components.Ensure unique DHS datasets are available to Mission Centers, the IC and law enforcement partners to strengthen collaborative government efforts to counter threats.</li>
      <li>Provide unique data on immigration, travel and intelligence, analytic tools and technical infrastructure to assist the U.S. Government stand-up of the National Vetting Center.</li>
      <li>Invest in our people, who are critical for achieving the above operating principles, by continuously improving our talent and leadership development to foster a cadre of high-performing Homeland Security intelligence professionals. (Office of Intelligence)</li>

    </ul>
